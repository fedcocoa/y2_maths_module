Use App Designer to create GUI to simulate Buffon's Needle with squares to estimate pi
buffon's needle:
drop needles onto a floor with a set of lines (distanced by 2*length of the needles) and record how many matches are intersecting with the lines on the floor.
then the ratio (total matches)/(matches that intersected a line) ~= Pi

Draw a set of axes
draw the set of floor lines
generate squares
draw squares
check intersections for squares


extend the gui to estimate sqrt(2) using the formula in the given reference

Extend the gui so that it drops needles on square tiles to estimate pi using the formula in the given reference

the user must be able to select which task is run
the user can adjust the number of needles, squares, planks of wood and square tiles
the program should allow at least 1,000,000 needles/squares to be dropped
